# Accelerometer Recorder
This small application was developed for my Undergraduate Dissertation), mainly to gather readings from the accelerometer sensor in smartphones for further digital signal processing

Records the accelerometer values from a smartphone and saves a CSV file in the phone's home directory called 'datasample.txt'

# How to install?
You can use Android Studio and import this project as an Android project. From there you can install the project on your device. Note that you probably want to install this on a physical phone but you can get virtualisation for Android phones that simulate sensor readings but a physical device is always better since the virtual devices won't pick up any noise, which is practically impossible in a real-world setting

# How to use?
Launch the application and ensure that you've changed the application permission settings on the phone to allow files to be saved on your phone
